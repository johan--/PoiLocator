PoiLocator
==========

A tutorial that shows how to visualize and search points of interest with JavaScript and PTV xServer internet

http://oliverheilig.github.io/PoiLocator/

To run the sample you need an xServer internet token. 
You can get a trial access [here](http://xserver.ptvgroup.com/en-uk/products/ptv-xserver-internet/test/)

Unlike other tutorials (e.g. https://github.com/oliverheilig/SpatialTutorial/wiki), it doen't need any special middleware. But only xServer and JavaScript. The JavaScript Libraries i'm using:

* Leaflet - a JavaScript Library for Mobile-Friendly Interactive Maps http://leafletjs.com/
* Leaflet-pip - a simple point-in-polygon function in JavaScript to find all POIs within an isochrone https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-pip
* http://lunrjs.com/ - a full text search engine in JavaScript to find all POIs matching a text.
